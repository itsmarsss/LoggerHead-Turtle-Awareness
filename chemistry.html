    <h1 id="ph-levels">pH Levels:</h1>
    <p>For loggerhead sea turtles, it is beneficial for the sand on the coast to have a high pH, low nutrient content,
        and a high concentration of salt. For their water habitat, the ideal pH of the water is between 7.4 to 8.0.</p>
    <h1 id="nutrient-levels">Nutrient Levels:</h1>
    <p>Nutrients, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, are essential in the health of ecosystems and loggerhead turtles.
        When there is nutrient runoff from the land that accumulates and builds up, this can result in eutrophication.
        This causes an overgrowth of algae and that results in the depletion of oxygen in the water. This is detrimental
        to marine life health and the health of loggerhead sea turtles as it will affect their diet and also their
        habitat.</p>
    <h1 id="heavy-metals">Heavy Metals:</h1>
    <p>There have been studies that heavy metals, such as mercury and lead, accumulate in loggerhead sea turtles'
        tissues. This is due to the fact that the turtles have longer lifespans and migrate a lot, making them more
        susceptible to heavy metal exposure.</p>
    <h1 id="redox--dissolved-oxygen">Redox ‚Üê Dissolved Oxygen:</h1>
    <p>Dissolved oxygen is a measure of how much oxygen has been dissolved in the water and how much oxygen is available
        to aquatic life. Loggerhead turtles rely on the oxygen in the water to aid in their metabolic processes as well
        as respiration. You can test the amount of oxygen present in the water by conducting an experiment known as the
        Winkler method and performing stoichiometric calculations to determine how much dissolved oxygen is present.
        Oxygen, as mentioned before, is important as lower levels of oxygen can pose difficulties for turtles and affect
        their well-being.</p>
    <h1 id="biochemistry-and-the-environment">Biochemistry And The Environment:</h1>
    <p>Xenobiotics are compounds that are present in organisms that are not normally found in the habitat. This can
        include plastic, which is often found in loggerhead turtle habitats. These turtles often ingest the plastic
        found on the beaches or in the ocean, which poses a great risk for their health. Plastic is a well-known
        substance that is detrimental to the environment. It is made of additional polymers formed by alkenes. When the
        alkenes are added together, this creates a long chain of hydrocarbons with functional groups that allow for
        plastic to have its properties. The hydrocarbon chains result in the difficulty faced by plastic in breaking
        down as they must also be exposed to higher temperatures and sunlight.</p>
