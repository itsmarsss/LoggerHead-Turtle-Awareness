                    <h1 id="basic-information">Basic Information:</h1>
                    <p>Loggerhead sea turtles, with their large, robust shells, are predominantly found in tropical
                        waters
                        of the
                        Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. These highly migratory creatures travel an average
                        distance of
                        7,500 miles
                        between their breeding beaches and hunting grounds. While they breed on land, loggerhead sea
                        turtles
                        spend the
                        majority of their time submerged in water. Presently, their population in the wild stands at
                        approximately
                        200,000 individuals.</p>
                    <h1 id="endangerment">Endangerment:</h1>
                    <p>The endangerment of loggerhead sea turtles stems from various factors. Accidental entanglement in
                        fishing gears
                        and nets leads to their demise, while human hunting targets them for their meat, skin, and
                        shells.
                        Ocean
                        pollution and marine debris contribute significantly to their deaths, as ingestion of plastic
                        mistaken for food
                        results in suffocation. Reproduction is challenging due to hatchling vulnerability to predators
                        such
                        as ghost
                        crabs, raccoons, skunks, foxes, and dogs. Climate change amplifies threats through higher sand
                        temperatures,
                        which can be lethal to turtle eggs. Rising seas and storm events cause beach erosion,
                        potentially
                        flooding or
                        washing away nests. Moreover, the instinct of hatchlings to seek the moon's light is confounded
                        by
                        coastal
                        development lights, leading them towards roads and perilous outcomes.</p>
                    <h1 id="existing-initiatives">Existing initiatives:</h1>
                    <p>Efforts to protect loggerhead sea turtles, an endangered species, have been undertaken by the
                        government. One
                        initiative is Nesting Beach Protection, which involves monitoring nesting beaches and
                        implementing
                        barriers to
                        safeguard their eggs from predators. In certain cases, nests are relocated to safer areas.
                        Another
                        measure is
                        the use of Turtle Excluder Devices, which selectively capture shrimp and fish while allowing
                        larger
                        marine life,
                        including loggerhead sea turtles, to escape as bycatch prevention. Marine Protected Areas,
                        legally
                        designated
                        ocean regions, serve as havens to shield marine life, including loggerhead sea turtles.</p>
                    <img class="media" src="ted.jpg" alt="LoggerHead Turtle">
                    <h1 id="awareness-campaign-idea">Awareness Campaign Idea</h1>
                    <p>To address the various challenges faced by loggerhead sea turtles, a comprehensive approach could
                        involve a
                        combination of habitat and conservatory measures. One potential solution is the creation of a
                        3-D
                        habitat
                        structure that accommodates both their land-based and underwater needs. This structure could
                        feature
                        a split
                        design, with half situated on land and half underwater.</p>
                    <p>The underwater portion of the habitat could address the issue of accidental capture by fisheries.
                        By
                        incorporating Turtle Excluder Devices or similar mechanisms, the structure would help prevent
                        loggerhead sea
                        turtles from being unintentionally caught as bycatch.</p>
                    <p>The land-based section of the habitat would primarily focus on mitigating the impact of sea
                        debris on
                        the nesting
                        process. It could serve as a barrier to prevent debris from being washed ashore, thereby
                        facilitating successful
                        nesting for loggerhead turtles. This would also help protect newborn loggerheads from
                        entanglement
                        in the
                        debris, ensuring their safety and survival.</p>
                    <p>The urgency for such measures is highlighted by the decline in the loggerhead sea turtle
                        population.
                        Statistics
                        reveal a significant drop in loggerhead numbers in the wild, underscoring the need for immediate
                        conservation
                        efforts. By comparing the current living conditions of loggerhead turtles to the ideal
                        conditions
                        provided by
                        the proposed 3-D habitat structure, the importance of creating a safe and suitable environment
                        for
                        these
                        turtles, as well as other marine life, becomes evident.</p>
                    <h2 id="one-possible-solution-involving-ted">One Possible Solution Involving TED</h2>
                    <p>One potential solution to address the issue of ocean plastic pollution involves implementing a
                        payment system
                        based on the weight of plastic collected. This incentivizes individuals or organizations to
                        actively
                        participate
                        in cleaning up marine debris, including the majority of polyethylene plastics.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, the collected plastic can be utilized to offset material costs for Turtle Excluder
                        Device (TED)
                        producers. By repurposing the collected plastic for manufacturing TEDs, the overall cost of
                        production can be
                        reduced, making these crucial devices more accessible and affordable.</p>
                    <p>Implementing such solutions not only helps combat plastic pollution but also creates employment
                        opportunities in
                        local areas. Job roles for trash collectors and TED manufacturers can be generated, fostering
                        economic growth
                        while addressing environmental concerns.</p>
                    <p>Considering the prevalence of polyethylene in ocean plastics, targeting this specific type of
                        plastic
                        for
                        collection and recycling efforts becomes crucial for effective mitigation of marine pollution.
                        By
                        focusing on
                        polyethylene, substantial progress can be made in reducing the overall impact of plastic waste
                        on
                        marine
                        ecosystems.</p>

                <h1 id="limiting-factors">Limiting Factors:</h1>
	<p>Limiting Factors are factors that place an upper limit on the size of the population. There are 6 main factors that are applicable to animals:<p>
	<ol>
	<li>Temperature</li>
	<li>Water</li>
	<li>Breeding sites</li>
	<li>Food supply</li>
	<li>Territory</li>
	<li>Salinity</li>
	</ol>
	</p>

	<ul>
	<li>Temperature: Loggerhead sea turtles thrive when the temperature is above 22 degrees celsius in the water.</li>
	<li>Water: Loggerhead sea turtles primarily live underwater so they don't necessarily have a set limit as to how much water they should intake.</li>
	<li>Breeding Sites: As mentioned before, loggerhead turtles breed on sandy beaches and this is an example of natal homing where a species returns back to their birthplace to breed and reproduce.</li>
	<li>Food Supply: Loggerhead sea turtles need to live in waters where they have access to crustaceans, fish, seaweed, sargassum, and other marine animals.</li>
	<li>Territory: Loggerhead turtles are found primarily in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, as well as the Mediterranean Sea.</li>
	<li>Salinity: Loggerhead turtles live only in salt water environments.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Loggerhead turtles, as with many other species, have predators and prey. As baby turtles, a few predators include raccoons, ghost crabs, foxes, skunks, etc. When they are grown up, they mainly face predation from sharks and humans. As mentioned previously, loggerhead turtles also prey on other sea creatures for food such as jellyfish, shrimp, fish, sponges, etc. Loggerhead turtles are important in the food chain as they are known as keystone species. Keystone species are species that are crucial in the ecosystem and if they are removed, the ecosystem would change drastically. Loggerhead turtles are important in the ecosystem because they increase the rate of nutrient recycling by breaking up the shells of crustaceans. They also promote diversity around the world in the seam water and are important sources of food for other animals. These turtles help in controlling the population of jellyfish and also maintain the coral reef and its health.</p>
	

    <h1 id="impacts-of-humans-on-ecosystems">Impacts Of Humans On Ecosystems:</h1>
	<p>Bioaccumulation is the process where living organisms accumulate toxins in their body through the food they consume. In waterways, inorganic mercury is converted to organic methyl-mercury. This organic form of mercury is readily absorbed by plankton, which is then absorbed by other organisms that are included in a Loggerhead turtles diet including crabs, fish, and mollusks which results in the turtles consuming a greater concentration of chemicals. This process is called biomagnification.</p>
	
	<p>Both macro and micro plastics are ubiquitously present throughout our oceans. Transported by gyres, high concentrations of plastic shred into microplastics are carried through coastal regions across the North and South Pacific Ocean. Due to the turtles wide variety in diet and inhibition in coastal areas, the Logger back are often susceptible to encountering and ingesting pollutants such as plastic debris and urban area runoff that often impact nearby coasts. These plastics can either be consumed directly or indirectly through bioaccumulation. Directly, plastic ingestion may be mistakenly identified as normal prey such as jellyfish and other small organisms, or caught in their normal dietary items such as macro algae.</p>
