# pH Levels:
For loggerhead sea turtles, it is beneficial for the sand on the coast to have a high pH, low nutrient content, and a high concentration of salt. For their water habitat, the ideal pH of the water is between 7.4 to 8.0.

# Nutrient Levels:
Nutrients, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, are essential in the health of ecosystems and loggerhead turtles. When there is nutrient runoff from the land that accumulates and builds up, this can result in eutrophication. This causes an overgrowth of algae and that results in the depletion of oxygen in the water. This is detrimental to marine life health and the health of loggerhead sea turtles as it will affect their diet and also their habitat.

# Heavy Metals:
There have been studies that heavy metals, such as mercury and lead, accumulate in loggerhead sea turtles' tissues. This is due to the fact that the turtles have longer lifespans and migrate a lot, making them more susceptible to heavy metal exposure.

# Redox &rarr; Dissolved Oxygen:
Dissolved oxygen is a measure of how much oxygen has been dissolved in the water and how much oxygen is available to aquatic life. Loggerhead turtles rely on the oxygen in the water to aid in their metabolic processes as well as respiration. You can test the amount of oxygen present in the water by conducting an experiment known as the Winkler method and performing stoichiometric calculations to determine how much dissolved oxygen is present. Oxygen, as mentioned before, is important as lower levels of oxygen can pose difficulties for turtles and affect their well-being.

# Biochemistry And The Environment:
Xenobiotics are compounds that are present in organisms that are not normally found in the habitat. This can include plastic, which is often found in loggerhead turtle habitats. These turtles often ingest the plastic found on the beaches or in the ocean, which poses a great risk for their health. Plastic is a well-known substance that is detrimental to the environment. It is made of additional polymers formed by alkenes. When the alkenes are added together, this creates a long chain of hydrocarbons with functional groups that allow for plastic to have its properties. The hydrocarbon chains result in the difficulty faced by plastic in breaking down as they must also be exposed to higher temperatures and sunlight.
