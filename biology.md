# Limiting Factors
Limiting Factors are factors that place an upper limit on the size of the population. There are 6 main factors that are applicable to animals:

1. Temperature
2. Water
3. Breeding sites
4. Food supply
5. Territory
6. Salinity

- Temperature: Loggerhead sea turtles thrive when the temperature is above 22 degrees celsius in the water.
- Water: Loggerhead sea turtles primarily live underwater so they donâ€™t necessarily have a set limit as to how much water they should intake.
- Breeding Sites: As mentioned before, loggerhead turtles breed on sandy beaches and this is an example of natal homing where a species returns back to their birthplace to breed and reproduce.
- Food Supply: Loggerhead sea turtles need to live in waters where they have access to crustaceans, fish, seaweed, sargassum, and other marine animals.
- Territory: Loggerhead turtles are found primarily in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, as well as the Mediterranean Sea.
- Salinity: Loggerhead turtles live only in salt water environments.

Loggerhead turtles, as with many other species, have predators and prey. As baby turtles, a few predators include raccoons, ghost crabs, foxes, skunks, etc. When they are grown up, they mainly face predation from sharks and humans. As mentioned previously, loggerhead turtles also prey on other sea creatures for food such as jellyfish, shrimp, fish, sponges, etc. Loggerhead turtles are important in the food chain as they are known as keystone species. Keystone species are species that are crucial in the ecosystem and if they are removed, the ecosystem would change drastically. Loggerhead turtles are important in the ecosystem because they increase the rate of nutrient recycling by breaking up the shells of crustaceans. They also promote diversity around the world in the seam water and are important sources of food for other animals. These turtles help in controlling the population of jellyfish and also maintain the coral reef and its health.

# Impacts of humans on ecosystems
Bioaccumulation is the process where living organisms accumulate toxins in their body through the food they consume. In waterways, inorganic mercury is converted to organic methyl-mercury. This organic form of mercury is readily absorbed by plankton, which is then absorbed by other organisms that are included in a Loggerhead turtles diet including crabs, fish, and mollusks which results in the turtles consuming a greater concentration of chemicals. This process is called biomagnification.

Both macro and micro plastics are ubiquitously present throughout our oceans. Transported by gyres, high concentrations of plastic shred into microplastics are carried through coastal regions across the North and South Pacific Ocean. Due to the turtles wide variety in diet and inhibition in coastal areas, the Logger back are often susceptible to encountering and ingesting pollutants such as plastic debris and urban area runoff that often impact nearby coasts. These plastics can either be consumed directly or indirectly through bioaccumulation. Directly, plastic ingestion may be mistakenly identified as normal prey such as jellyfish and other small organisms, or caught in their normal dietary items such as macro algae.
